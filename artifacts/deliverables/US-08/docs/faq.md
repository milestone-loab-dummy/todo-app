# FAQ — Filter Todos by Status (US-08)

## How do I filter todos?

Use the filter bar at the bottom of the page. Click **All**, **Active**, or **Completed** to switch views.

## What does each filter show?

- **All** — shows every todo regardless of status
- **Active** — shows only todos that are not yet complete
- **Completed** — shows only todos that are marked done

## How do I know which filter is active?

The selected filter is visually highlighted in the filter bar.

## Does filtering delete any todos?

No. Filtering only changes what is displayed. Your todos are not modified or removed.

## Does the filter apply to the count in the footer?

The footer always shows the count of **active** (incomplete) todos, regardless of which filter is selected.

## Can I combine filters?

No. Only one filter can be active at a time.

## Does the filter reset when I add a new todo?

No. The active filter stays selected. If you are on the "Completed" filter and add a new todo, it will not appear in the list until you switch to "All" or "Active".

## Does the filter persist after a page refresh?

No. The filter resets to "All" when you reload the page.
