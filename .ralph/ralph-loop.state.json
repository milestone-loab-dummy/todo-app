  "prompt": "Implement Sprint 2 for the Todo App project. Work inside the current directory (projects/todo-app/).\n\n## Sprint Goal\nThe app is complete enough for daily use — edit, filter, search, and bulk actions all work.\n\n## Stack\n- Backend: Go + Gin + GORM + SQLite in backend/\n- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite in frontend/\n- Backend port: 8080, Frontend port: 3000\n\n## Context\nSprint 1 is already complete. The app has: create, list, toggle complete, edit title (inline), delete, filter (All/Active/Completed), skeleton loader, toast errors, hover-delete button.\n\nRead the existing frontend/src/App.tsx and related files before making changes so you understand the current state.\n\n---\n\n## US-06 — Edit a Todo Title (verify existing implementation)\nVerify these acceptance criteria are already met; fix or add if missing:\n- Double-click todo title enters inline edit mode (input replaces title text)\n- Enter or blur saves new title via PUT /todos/:id\n- Escape cancels edit and restores original title\n- Empty title cancels edit silently\n- Saved title persists across page reloads (fetched from DB)\n\n---\n\n## US-08 — Filter Todos by Status (verify existing implementation)\nVerify these acceptance criteria are already met; fix or add if missing:\n- Footer filter buttons: All | Active | Completed\n- \"Active\" shows only incomplete todos\n- \"Completed\" shows only completed todos\n- \"All\" shows all todos\n- Active filter button is visually highlighted (e.g. border, bold, or color change)\n\n---\n\n## US-09 — Search Todos (NEW)\nAdd a search input field to the UI:\n- Typing in the search box filters the displayed todos case-insensitively by title\n- Clearing the search box restores the full list (respecting the active status filter)\n- When no todos match the search, show a \"No results for ...\" message\n- Search is client-side (no new backend endpoint needed)\n- Search and filter work together (search within the currently filtered set)\n\n---\n\n## US-10 — Bulk Actions (NEW)\nAdd bulk action controls to the footer:\n- Show \"X items left\" count where X = number of active (incomplete) todos\n- \"Mark all complete\" button:\n  - If any todos are active: mark ALL todos completed (call PUT /todos/:id for each)\n  - If ALL todos are already completed: mark ALL todos active (toggle behaviour)\n- \"Clear completed\" button:\n  - Delete all completed todos (call DELETE /todos/:id for each)\n  - Only show this button when there is at least one completed todo\n- Both buttons call the real backend API (no optimistic-only updates)\n- Refresh the list after bulk operations complete\n\n---\n\n## API Contract (unchanged from Sprint 1)\n- GET    /health      → 200 {\"status\":\"ok\"}\n- GET    /todos       → 200 [{...}]\n- POST   /todos       → 201 {...}\n- PUT    /todos/:id   → 200 {...}  body: {\"title\":\"string\",\"completed\":bool}\n- DELETE /todos/:id   → 204\n\n---\n\n## Definition of Done\n- go build ./... (from backend/) — no errors\n- go vet ./... (from backend/) — no errors\n- npm run build (from frontend/) — zero TypeScript errors\n- No TypeScript any types\n- No hardcoded URLs (VITE_API_URL)\n- All 4 stories verified working\n\n---\n\n## Rules\n1. Read existing source files before editing them\n2. After every frontend change: run npm run build from frontend/ and fix ALL TypeScript errors before continuing\n3. After any backend change: run go build ./... and go vet ./... from backend/\n4. Do not break Sprint 1 features (create, list, toggle, delete, filter, toast, skeleton)\n5. Implement in order: verify US-06, verify US-08, implement US-09, implement US-10\n\nWhen ALL 4 stories are verified/implemented, both builds pass cleanly, output exactly:\nCOMPLETE",
